Personalized nutrition advice based on user goals (weight loss, muscle gain, diabetic-friendly, vegan, etc.)

Health tips beyond diet: hydration, exercise, and mindful eating

Friendly, supportive, and motivational conversational tone

Uses structured data (50 foods + 10 meal plans) with nutrition facts & health benefits

Deployed using IBM Watsonx.ai Agent Builder and Vector Index

**Technology Stack**

IBM Watsonx.ai – Agent Builder using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Vector Index – Knowledge base created from custom nutrition dataset

IBM Cloud Object Storage – Stores files and supports the project backend

TXT Knowledge File – Contains structured data on 50 food items & 10 meal plans

Python – Used for formatting, cleaning, and preparing dataset

Dataset Overview

Structured data of 50 food items and 10 meal plans includes:

Macronutrients: calories, protein, carbs, fats

Diet types: vegan, vegetarian, non-vegetarian, diabetic-friendly

Health benefits and food swap suggestions

**Process Overview**

Created a project on IBM Watsonx.ai (London region)

Prepared nutrition dataset and converted it to .txt format

Uploaded the file to Vector Index in Agent Builder (Knowledge tab)

Configured prompts for friendly, dietician-style responses

Tested and deployed agent for real-time nutrition queries

**Future Scope**

Integrate fitness tracker and calorie calculator
